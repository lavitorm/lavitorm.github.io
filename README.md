Web Developer educated at UC Berkeley Continuing Ed program, with experience primarily in hands-on Front-end focused Software Development, but with an interest in scalable applications using JavaScript and related technologies. In a previous career, I was a cross-disciplinary multi-project leader in Business Development. 

When I started, the team didn’t have a grasp on some of the fundamentals they needed, but after accessing the situation, I developed the framework and process to help them master the essential skills in problem-solving. I have been programming as a hobby since college, and I recently rekindled this passion. 

In addition, I’ve developed an eye for design with extensive experience acquired while constructing effective detail-oriented beautiful corporate presentations. 

Furthermore, proven comprehension of various coding languages to build web captivating applications have given me a solid base upon which I plan to continue to grow my career in motivated, team-oriented, creative, diverse, agile, customer-centric, technologically and data-driven environments.
