Web Developer educated at UC Berkeley Continuing Ed program, with experience primarily in hands-on Front-end focused Software Development, but with an interest in interactive scalable applications using JavaScript and related technologies. 

In a previous career, I was a cross-disciplinary multi-project leader in Business Development. When I started, the team didn’t have a grasp on some of the fundamentals they needed, but after accessing the situation, I developed a framework and process to drive a data mindset to enhance essential critical thinking and problem-solving skills. 

I have been programming as a hobby since college, and I recently rekindled this passion. In addition, I’ve developed an eye for design with extensive experience acquired while constructing effective detail-oriented beautiful presentations for different stakeholders in many projects. 

My background in finance demanded extensive application of business intelligence tools. That helped me to develop a foundation to work with relational database management systems. Furthermore, proven comprehension of various coding languages to build web captivating applications have given me a solid base upon which I plan to continue to grow my career in exceptional teamwork environments that are genuinely people-oriented, customer-centric and data-driven.
